# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a clearly labeled “Developer Story” section to the existing Credits page.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Credits page UI to include a new section titled “Developer Story”.
- Add English user-facing text stating that Henry English is the founder and technical manager of the app and that he believes in an Uber-style format.
- Ensure the existing Credits content remains intact, including naming “Henry English” and the phrase “A Sierra Leone Living Legend”.

**User-visible outcome:** Users viewing the Credits page will see an additional “Developer Story” section describing Henry English as the founder and technical manageruses, and noting his belief in an Uber-style format, while existing Credits information remains unchanged.
